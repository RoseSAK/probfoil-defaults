Known issues
============
(Please report any problems to anton.dries@cs.kuleuven.be)

- algorithm does not handle cycles in grounding (but it detects them and throws an exception)
    => solution: use ProbLog's toCNF conversion method (requires modifications in ProbLog)
        
Possible improvements
=====================
    
* efficiency - without effect on solution
    - initial score calculation
        => use Prolog to find examples in the data (only relevant for target with arity > 1)
    - grounding
        => incremental grounding, requires small change to ProbLog grounder so that it can use 'already_grounded' information

* efficiency - with effect on solution
    - refinement operator shouldn't generate unconnected literals e.g.: tg(X,Y) :- a(A,B).
    
    - disallow free variables in body: e.g. tg(X) :- a(X,A).    (These can be are very expensive to compute.)
        => requires refinement operator that can add multiple literals add the same time
        => try 'partial' evaluation => 0/1 => bounds on score
        
* algorithm
